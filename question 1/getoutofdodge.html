			<h3>Useful tools in your "Get out of Dodge" kit.</h3>
			<p><strong>There's survival kits for all kinds of situations: earthquakes, hurricanes, blackouts, you name it! Well, why not have one for a zombie apocalypse? Isn't that just as important?</strong> Sure, a zombie apocalypse seems a little bit, oh, i don't know, INSANE, but it's still something everyone should be prepared for, should it occur. Here are some things to put in your "Handy Dandy Zombie Survival Kit!":
		</div>
		<div>
			<h4><strong>The essentials. No matter the situation, you've gotta have the essentials.</strong></h4>
			<p>"What are the essentials?" you may be asking yourself. Well, the essentials are, well, essential!</p>
            <p><strong>Water is the most crucial thing, however.</strong> In the case of a zombie apocalypse, you aren't sure what spread the virus. Maybe it was the water supply. Make sure you always have some fresh water handy. And a purifier if you can get your hands on one.</p>

		</div>
		<div>
			<h4><strong>What goes really well with water? If you guessed a handgun, you're WRONG. We'll get to that in a little bit, however.</strong></h4>
			<p><strong>If you managed to guess food, congratulations, you get a COOKIE!</strong> Food, especially unperishable food, is the second most essential item in the kit. The reason it's second is because you can live without food for about a week, maybe a week and a half. You can only survive without water for THREE TO FIVE DAYS. Always have a good storage of food and water with you.</p>
		</div>
        <div>
            <h4><strong>Now to the third and final thing in the kit: Weapons!</strong></h4>
            <p>Now those of you who guessed "handgun" in the previous section can get what they came for! <strong>There are three weapons in the "Handy Dandy Zombie Survival Kit!"</strong>.</p>
            <p>There is a standard combat knife, for those close encounters and for killing any game you might find if you're in the wilderness.</p>
            <p>There is also an m9 tactical pistol with silencer. This is just in case you have a horde around you and you want to take them out, one at a time, as quiet as possible.</p>
            <p>The third and final weapon is the most fun: A MINI-CHAINSAW! Newly developed, this 50 lb miniature chainsaw will cut through just about anything necessary with ease! (Not recommended for children or people with a fantasy of going at a horde with a chainsaw)</p>
            <p><strong>And there you have it, folks! The ultimate "Get out of Dodge" zombie survival kit! Call now (if you aren't a zombie yet) to order for just $599.99! (Plus Processing and Handling)</strong></p>
