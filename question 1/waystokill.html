			<h3>Ways to kill a zombie, should you be unfortunate enough to come upon one...</h3>
			<p>Zombies are a tricky bunch. You think they're just regular people, walkin' around with their faces and hands smeared with blood, and then, all of a sudden, they're on top of you, trying to tear you to pieces! Here are a few choice ways of getting rid of the pesky little buggers:</p>
		<div class="clear"></div>
            <h4><strong>Aim for the head when dealing with a zombie close range!</strong></h4>
            <p>Remember this: the only reason a zombie can move around and attack people while it's body is DECAYING is because there is some kind of virus keeping the brain stem active. Take it's head off, destroy it's brain, or sever its brain stem in some way, and it'll drop like a sack of potatoes.</p>
            <h4><strong>If you should shoot a zombie and it falls down, DO NOT ASSUME IT DEAD.</strong></h4>
            <p> Make sure it is actually dead by going up to it and shooting it in the head close range. It could be the last mistake you make if you just shoot it and get too close.</p>
            <h4><strong>When all else fails, RUN!</strong></h4>
            <p>If you don't have any weapons, or you have too little ammo to deal with all of the zombies coming at you, GET THE HECK OUTTA THERE! There's no use in risking your life if you can't survive with what you have. R U N!</p>
        <div class="clear"></div>
             <h3>And those, my friends, are the most basic of rules to remember when dealing with any type of zombie, be they dead or turning.</h3>
        </div>
