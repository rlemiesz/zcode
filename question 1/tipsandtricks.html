			<h3>Ways to deal with your family and closest friends becoming zombies right before your eyes...</h3>
			<<p><strong>Let's say you're walking along the street, trying to find provisions to help your survivor group in a zombie apocalypse stay alive. Out of nowhere, your best friend comes out of a dark alleyway, screaming "He bit me!".</strong> What would you do?</p>
	        <p>Well, in this situation, there are basically three things you can do. I have to warn you, though, none of them are pretty, and none of them will make you feel better in the end.</p>
            <h4><strong>#1 is probably the most painful for both persons involved. Shoot them in the head as soon as they turn.</strong></h4>
            <p>Now, you're probably saying "WHAT? I WOULD NEVER DO THAT!" Think about this: what if the person, who is just about to die and come back as a living nightmare, asks you to do it? Would you just deny them that wish? Probably not.</p>
            <h4><strong>#2 is only bad for the person turning.</strong></h4>
            <p>You could keep them with you, hoping that they won't turn into a zombie before some kind of cure is found/invented. All the while, the person who is turning is suffering pretty badly.</p>
            <h4><strong>#3 is the most humane.</strong></h4>
            <p>Some people would probably just give up if they were turning. They might ask you for a gun and to be taken to a nice, quiet place to pass on. At least this is a lot less painful and it's the person's choice.</p>
            <h3>See? Told ya none of these would be the prettiest or nicest way to end things, but if this does happen, they must be taken into consideration.</h3>
