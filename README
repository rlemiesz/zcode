Question 1- The homepage is index.html  All linked pages are getoutofdodge.html (page 2), ways to kill.html (page 3), and tipsandtricks.html (page 4)
I did use a template for the responsive web design part. You can find it at www.getskeleton.com
I edited skeleton and added/removed things I wanted/didn't want.

Question 2- I found a program called Microsoft Visual Studio 2010, which, after using the express version to edit the question 1 html more readily, I used to create the books for the question 2 answer.
I did look up pretty much everything for the books part, especially rotating and alphabetizing them.
The main .exe file to run the bookcase (if you can call it that) is under \Question 2\Ninjabooks\bin\Debug\Ninjabooks.exe
The code for said .exe is Ninjabooks.vbproj which is under \question 2\Ninjabooks

Question 3- Pretty self explanatory. I simply typed it up, and then edited it to my liking. The answer is the only file in the folder, which is \question 3\Dragon Zoo.docx

Question 4- Again, pretty simple. It took much less time to type this one, because I already knew what I wanted to say in it.
Answer is under \Question 4\Question 4.docx
